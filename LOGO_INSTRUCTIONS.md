# Adding University Logos

You'll need to add two logo images to your website:

## Required Logo Files:

1. **uiuc_logo.png** - University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign logo
2. **mumbai_logo.png** - University of Mumbai logo

## Where to Get Logos:

### UIUC Logo:
- Visit: https://brand.illinois.edu/visual-identity/logos/
- Download the official university logo (preferably transparent background PNG)
- Save as `uiuc_logo.png`

### University of Mumbai Logo:
- Search Google for "University of Mumbai logo png"
- Download an official logo (transparent background preferred)
- Save as `mumbai_logo.png`

## How to Add Logos:

1. **Download/save your logo files** as:
   - `uiuc_logo.png`
   - `mumbai_logo.png`

2. **Upload to your GitHub repository:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop both logo files
   - Commit the changes

3. **That's it!** The logos will automatically appear in the Education section

## Logo Specifications:

- **Format:** PNG (with transparent background preferred)
- **Recommended size:** 200x200 pixels or higher
- **The website will automatically resize them** to 80x80 pixels

## Alternative if Logos Aren't Available:

If you can't find official logos right away, the website will show broken image icons. You can:
1. Use placeholder images temporarily
2. Or ask me to help create simple text-based logo placeholders

**Note:** Make sure the filenames are exactly `uiuc_logo.png` and `mumbai_logo.png` (case-sensitive on some systems).
